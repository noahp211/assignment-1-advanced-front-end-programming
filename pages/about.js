      <h1>What This Assignment Is About</h1>
      <p>This project is part of my coursework for Advanced Front-End Development. I'm using React and Next.js to advance my skills and build a small app that helps me understand key ideas like components, state, props, and routing.</p>
      <p>Itâ€™s quote simple from first glance, but the goal is to learn how, make them interactive, and organize everything clearly with no errors</p>
